before we do, am realizing that we only have the AI api keys (OPENAI\_API\_KEY) and (GEMINI\_API\_KEY) in railway and not in vercel. doesnt it make sense for me to add that over here if this is the UI side? theoretically we know have the tools assuming variables are in teh write place to have a smart prospecting app. Something research's and allows us to research research the accts. THe original ideal was a dossier on each acct. Do we now have the tools to generate those dossiers on the acct level 

The second image has acct level view. The blue AI research button doesnt work. Does it make sense to set it up w/ GEMINI\_API\_KEY as primary and OPENAI\_API\_KEY as fall back like we have in the other repo? Have added them to vercel with those names. Can get the value in vercel if you need them. The apis should power the brain and the agents in the background. 

also the brain doesn't work \-- see image one \-- is that the same prob? No env var in vercel?  the idea with the brain is that you can use it anywhere to control the 'limbs' of the app. should be able to use it brain to improve understand at the acct/company level, the people level the sequence., the ROI calc, etc. is all supposed to be smart and powered by the brain which has API key  from our google cloud work space acct, the idea with the integrations was to have the google drive right there, gmail access right there, etc. have crossed out the response bc that is not important but refer the third image to get an idea what the brain is supposed to look like. Need to be sure this sprint I am asking you to formulate is something that we can prioritize and execute in rolling updates. Do not expect to be able to get it all done in one sprint that says more power to us if we can. Should have the bones to get the brain working with the UI like we want to by tomorrow. key word being WORKING.. 

Lastly, where is our bulk email functionality? WtF?

break this project down into sprints and tasks, how would you do it (timeline info does not need included and doesnt matter) \- every task/ticket should be an atomic, committable piece of work with tests (and if tests don't make sense another form of validation that it was completed successfully), every sprint should result in a demoable piece of software that can be run, tested, and build on top of previous work/sprints. Be exhaustive, be clear, be technical. Always focus on small atomic tasks that compose up into a clear goal for the sprint. Once you're done, provide this prompt to a subagent to review your work and suggest improvements. When you're done reviewing the suggested improvements write your tasks/tickets, sprint plans, etc to update the latest md file

LAST BUT NOT LEAST WHAT IS ANYTHING DO YOU NEED ME TO SHARE WITH THE OTHER REPO TO MAKE THIS SMOOTH, EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE AS POSSIBLE
